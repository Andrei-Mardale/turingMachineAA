# turingMachineAA
My first Algorithm Analysis homework

A C implementation which simulates a Turing Machine.

#How to compile
"make build"

#How to run
"make run"

#Input
The program expects the codification of a Turing Machine (the rules for this are described in the statement) and it's input in the file "date.in"

#Output
The program executes the Turing Machine and outputs the result to the file "date.out".

#Extra
In the file "matrice.in" I have described a Turing Machine which compares two binary numbers of the same length. (this was part of the homework)
